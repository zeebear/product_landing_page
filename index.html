      <h2>Caelan's Custom Cauldrons</h2>
      <p><a href="http://hedgecroft.net/blogs/?p=190"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/diyosnlxf/image/upload/v1588902472/EARTH-CAULDRON-inter1.jpg" alt="A image of a cauldron left with a large hole after an explosion while brewing (Actually, an image of the bronze Earth Cauldron by Rae Atira-Soncea" id="exploded_cauldron"></a>We have all witnessed the potentially devestating effects of an explosion while brewing. Volatile ingredients, shoddy technique, a moment of carelessness, or some foolish wand-waving -- there are many dangers involved in brewing potions. With a sub-standard cauldron you, too, may someday end up with a cauldron like this!</p>
      <p>Reduce the danger inherent in brewing by using a Custom Cauldron from Caelan. Caelan's cauldrons are available in a wide range of materials and sizes, and ALL exceed the ministry-mandated minimum thickness required to prevent potions puncturing the cauldron during explosions. So no matter whether you're buying your first cauldron before jumping on the Hogwarts Express, or commissioning a self-spelling cauldron to grace the private laboratory of your family for centuries to come,</p>
      <p><span>choose Caelan's Custom Cauldrons</span> for guaranteed quality and safety.</p>

      <h2>Highlights from our store</h2>
      <div class="highlight" id="self-spell-1">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundestrup_cauldron" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/diyosnlxf/image/upload/v1588902456/640px-Silver_cauldron.jpg" alt="An image of the silver Gundestrup cauldron"></a>
        <p>Our silver signature model self-spelling cauldron is celebrating 2150 years in production this year. Each of its eight panels can store up to 108 spells, for a total of 864 spells. Two stirring-rod rests are included as standard.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="highlight" id="self-spell-2">
        <a href="http://hedgecroft.net/blogs/?p=404" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/diyosnlxf/image/upload/v1588902462/fire-cauldron-face.jpg" alt="An image of the bronze Fire Cauldron by Rae Atira-Soncea"></a>
        <p>Don't be put off by appearances! While only in possession of a mere three faces, this bronze self-spelling cauldron is able to handle the most demanding spells up to NEWT level and beyond. This latest addition to our self-spelling range will complement the most minimalist of decor.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="highlight" id="self-spell-3">
        <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/ancient-gold-cauldron-lawsuit-274597" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/diyosnlxf/image/upload/v1588902456/gold_cauldron.jpg" alt="An image of the golden Chiemsee Cauldron"></a>
        <p>One of our newest self-spelling cauldrons, this model is available in solid gold. The original was made by our firm in 1926, but it was stolen shortly after its completion, probably by Gellert Grindelwald, and was never seen again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="highlight" id="self-spell-4">
        <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/12/16/great-aspirations-iron-age/" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/diyosnlxf/image/upload/v1588902457/cauldron-stand-Assyria.jpg" alt="An image of a bronze cauldron from the 8th century BC, Nicosia"></a>
        <p>One of our earliest models, this bronze self-spelling cauldron has been a favourite for almost 3000 years. In addition to incanting a variety of spells, the heads can also turn 180 degrees to add ingredients to the cauldron at the appropriate moment. As a bonus, they can sing in harmony for you, to while away the long hours of brewing.</p>

        <p>When we have some leftover material after making our cauldrons, we sometimes amuse ourselves by making mini cauldrons to use when baking Cauldron Cakes! Pictured above: Mini iron student-model cauldrons. Ask for your favourite cauldron material, or see what we have in stock.</p>

        <p>Recycle your old cauldrons! If you have an old cauldron by another manufacturer that is no longer in a fit state for use in potions making, bring it to us for disenchantment. It will then be safe to be reused for a non-magical purpose. We like the idea of using them as planters, as seen here.</p>

      <div>
        <p>At Caelan's Custom Cauldrons, we pride ourselves on the quality of our craftsmanship and the durability of our materials, even in our most basic models. Our cauldrons have withstood centuries of regular use by our happy customers.</p>
        <p>Occasionally a repair will be necessary, as with the cauldron shown above. It was made by us 800 years ago, and was used so heavily that it was recently brought in to us for repair. Here it is, ready for another 800 years or more of potioneering pleasure.</p>
        <p>If your Caelan's Cauldron has suffered a calamity, speak with our salesgoblin for further details about our Cauldron Cosseting service.</p>
